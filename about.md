About Me
========

Hey there, I'm James Ma. I graduated from Purdue University in Computer Science (with a concentration in Software Engineering and a minor in Psychology). I'm a Mac-loving, Android-embracing, UX/UI-appreciating kind of guy.

You can find me on [Twitter][], [Linkedin][] and [GitHub][]. You can [download my resume][] or check out what I've been up to below.

This website's design is inspired by the [Svbtle network](http://svbtle.com/) by [Dustin Curtis](http://dcurt.is/).
