John Gruber on [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/2012/09/amazons_play):

> Apple's goal is to sell as many iPads as it can. Amazon's goal is to sell as many Kindle Fires as it can to a specific audience: active Amazon.com customers. And for that specific audience, it's a very appealing proposition. The Fire makes it even easier to do things you're already doing -- reading Kindle e-books, watching movies and TV shows through your Prime membership. And the low prices speak to the heart of the Amazon.com customer base. When Bezos says he wants Amazon's interests aligned with those of their customers, he means it.

Amazon's unique business model with Kindle Fire is not to sell Android tablets, but to sell a service that is platform independent. The Kindle Fire is just a tool for accessing these services. Today, people want services, not gadgets.
