During class today my professor cracked a joke about the philosophy of CS:
<blockquote>
	If two CS professors walk towards each other and not say anything, that means the world is safe and sound... But if they start talking to each other, it means that something went wrong in the world of CS.
</blockquote>
He said it in such a whimsical yet truthful way, that I couldn't help but agree! Sometimes if a program does nothing after executing, it means that it's still working, or else it would've crashed =P
