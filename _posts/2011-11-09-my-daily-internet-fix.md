title: My Daily Internet Fix

I'd like to share with you how I traverse through the very interesting, never-ending, limitless, ever-expanding, (you get the idea) Internet!

As a CS enthusiast, I have my own sources of websites that I consider a must-see-everyday to update myself on this continuously expanding field. It is kind of like an addiction - if I don't update myself, I would feel like I'm separated from the world, lost like a memory leak!

From the way I see it, updating myself with internet news is the latest form of reading the newspaper, I envision myself in the future reading only news from websites, sipping coffee, growing white hair... It's such a beautiful sight!

Here's the list of the websites that you've been absolutely dying to read about:

<a href="http://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>: The epitome of internet geekery, filled with internet memes and vital yet senseless news that any normal person would be hooked onto. Yup I said it, you will be liking this website :)

<a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/" target="_blank">Ars Technica</a>: An all rounded website that discusses CS related news. If you think that a particular CS news is important, and it isn't here, it probably isn't that important.

<a href="http://www.ted.com/" target="_blank">TED</a>: Amazing videos about technology and concepts that would shape the future of our society.

<a href="http://www.macrumors.com/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>: I follow on Apple tech trends frequently and this website serves that purpose pretty well.

<a href="http://www.cnn.com/" target="_blank">CNN</a>: My internet newspaper, 'nuff said!
