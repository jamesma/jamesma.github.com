title: Steve Jobs
---

I have been reading Walter Isaacson's autobiography on Steve Jobs (the best-selling book so far for this year), and I have to say it's been interesting to have a glimpse into his life. This book is totally worth the read for you CS people out there, grab hold of it now if you haven't!

Right now I'm on Chapter 11: The Reality Distortion Field... This chapter gives an inside look into his power-driven, push-you-beyond-the-limit management that brought about Apple's success in the decades to come.

I am intrigued by the fact that Jobs was on drugs pretty much his whole young adult life. From reading the first 11 chapters of the book, it brought me to the conclusion that we should never assume that prominent figures are to be given respect automatically. I have re-evaluated my judgement on Jobs. Despite his phenomenal work that revolutionized personal computers, digital music players and touch devices, we should not naturally idolize or revere him. We must take into account his treatment to other people and how he lived his life.
