title: How I Traverse the Internet
---

Here's a list of websites that I visit daily for my internet fix:

1. [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) - Social user-curated news website where posts get upvoted or downvoted by users.
2. [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/news) - A website very much like Reddit but content is focused specifically on hacking and startups.
3. [Techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com/) - Web blog about technology news and analysis.
4. [GitHub](http://github.com/) - The web-based hosting service for open source projects.

I use [Flipboard](http://flipboard.com/) on my iPhone4 to subscribe to "Tech" news and I save unread articles to [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/) to read it later either on my iPhone or Macbook.
