title: Why You Should Try Learning Online
---

Recently, I chanced upon [this TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/daphne_koller_what_we_re_learning_from_online_education.html) by Daphne Koller that talks about her website [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org). She brings forward the point that knowledge is processed more effectively by students in the online classroom than a typical lecture hall. You learn at your own pace, have quality peer-to-peer discussions, self-graded assignments, from the best universities for free.

I'm quite amazed at the selection of computer science courses that are available. I've already signed up for a few courses:

1. [Human-Computer Interaction](http://www.coursera.org/course/hci) - Stanford
2. [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](http://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) - Martin Odersky (creator of Scala)
3. [Software Engineering for SaaS](http://www.coursera.org/course/saas) - UC Berkeley
4. [Networks: Friends, Money, and Bytes](http://www.coursera.org/course/friendsmoneybytes) - Princeton

There are 120 courses available currently and increasing. I highly recommend you to check it out.
