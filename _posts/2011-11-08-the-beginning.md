title: The Beginning

I've decided to start a blog for myself for the very first time. This is a rather late entry into the blogging scene, considering that I'm a Senior Computer Science student! Nevertheless, it's not too late!

My blogging itch developed due to one main reason: I want to tell the world what I am up to!

The plethora of social networking sites (i.e. Facebook) are not appropriate outlets for an individual to express his/her lingering thoughts deep in the recesses of the mind. Imagine if I started discussing intellectually heavy stuff on my Facebook wall... That just wouldn't be right would ppit?

So here we are, you have chanced onto my first blog post, I hope you as a reader will find what I write interesting!
